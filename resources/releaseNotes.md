# Release notes

The current version number is shown on the KNote entry in VS Code's
Extensions view.

## 1.0.0

- **KNote is now a VS Code extension.** The standalone Electron app is
  retired; your vault is any workspace folder containing `.knote/` (run
  **KNote: Initialize Vault in This Workspace** on a fresh folder). All
  data stays plain Markdown — existing vaults open unchanged.
- Notes are edited in VS Code's native Markdown editor, enhanced by KNote:
  clickable `[[wiki links]]` (create-on-click, `#heading`/`#^block`/alias
  forms), `[[`/`#` autocomplete, link hover previews, tag/priority/
  milestone decorations, paste-image into the attachments folder, and
  bold/italic/strikethrough/inline-code toggles
- The Kanban board, Timeline, Machine Log, Graph, and vault Settings open
  as editor tabs; Search (with `path:`/`tag:`/`file:` operators),
  Backlinks + unlinked mentions, Tags, and Properties live in the new
  KNote Activity Bar container
- Two-way sync got stronger: board/timeline/panel edits land directly in
  your open editor buffer (even with unsaved changes) and fall back to
  verified, conflict-refusing disk writes otherwise
- Task hotkeys: `Ctrl+L` cycles a task's column, `Ctrl+Alt+L` picks one
  (with require-reason prompts and `Status Changed` stamping),
  `Ctrl+Alt+X` toggles a checkbox, `Ctrl+Alt+Enter` seeds a task note
- Everything the app duplicated from VS Code is now native: file explorer,
  tabs/splits, quick switcher, command palette, hotkey editor, themes,
  spellcheck, and full-text search
- New **KNote: Clean Up Orphaned Attachments** command
- Dropped: the built-in live-preview editor (use VS Code's Markdown
  preview alongside the editor), the in-app hotkey editor, and the
  "Open in VS Code" bridge (you're already here)

## 0.12.0

- The Kanban board's filter bar gained three date filters — **Status
  Changed**, **Date Entered**, and **Due date** — each with an Any / Today /
  This week / specific date / custom range option, alongside the existing
  tag and text filters
- Tasks now carry a `Status Changed` line — seeded as `n/a` when the task's
  note template is created, then updated **in place** (never duplicated) to
  today's date every time the task's Kanban column changes (drag-and-drop or
  the checkbox right-click menu) — a running record of when a task last
  changed state, alongside the existing `Date Entered` (when it was added)
  and `Reason for <Column>` (why/since when, for columns that require one)
- **Right-click date editing**: right-click a task, milestone, or note in
  the Timeline view — or a machine log `🚜` entry, either in the log view
  or inline in a note — to change its date (and, for machine entries, the
  machine) with a calendar picker, instead of hunting it down in the note
- **Hyperlinks**: right-click in the editor and choose "Insert link…" to
  wrap the current selection (or fresh text) into a `[text](url)` Markdown
  link
- **Open vault in VS Code**: a new ribbon button (also in the command
  palette and **Settings → General**) opens the current vault as a VS Code
  workspace, creating a `.code-workspace` file in the vault's hidden
  `.knote` folder the first time
- Context menus (file explorer, editor) now show an icon next to each item
  instead of a plain text label
- Fixed archived tasks showing up as overdue in the Timeline view — they're
  now treated as done, like completed tasks
- Fixed the editor's search/replace panel having unreadable input and
  button styling under some themes

## 0.11.0

- **Tabs**: every note you open becomes a tab above the editor — click to
  switch, middle-click or `×` to close, `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` to
  cycle
- **Split panes**: "Split pane: vertical / horizontal" in the command
  palette opens a second pane with its own tabs and editor; "Close split"
  merges back. The same note open in both panes stays in sync
- **Custom keyboard shortcuts**: new **Settings → Hotkeys** section —
  record a new combination for any command palette entry, with conflict
  detection, unbind, and per-command reset to default
- **Block references**: end a line with ` ^some-id` to anchor it, link to
  it with `[[Note#^some-id]]`; typing `[[Note#^` suggests the note's
  anchors

## 0.10.1

- Internal cleanup & stability pass — no feature changes:
  - Fixed two rare write races that could clobber a note edited outside
    KNote at the exact moment KNote wrote to it (quick capture / board
    "add card" appends, and simultaneous saves of the same file)
  - New test coverage for the code that guards your notes during Kanban
    sync and external-edit detection (36 new tests)
  - Removed dead code, consolidated duplicated UI/parser logic, and added
    ESLint/Prettier with CI enforcement

## 0.10.0

- The `[[` link suggester now chains into a **heading suggester**: picking a
  note leaves the cursor right before the closing `]]`, so typing `#`
  immediately lists that note's headings — pick one to link straight to a
  section (`[[Note Name#Heading]]`) instead of typing the heading by hand

## 0.9.0

- Priority markers now render as **Low / Medium / High** word pills instead
  of plain `!`/`!!`/`!!!` marks, both on Kanban cards and in the editor's
  live-preview pill — clicking into the marker still shows the raw `!`s for
  editing
- Added a **Readable line length** toggle (**Settings → General**, on by
  default) to cap note width to a readable column instead of stretching
  text across the full pane in both the editor and reading view
- Pressing **Enter** to seed a task's note template (`Date Entered`/`Notes`)
  now only applies to top-level tasks — a subtask (indented under a parent
  task) gets normal list continuation instead, since subtasks are usually
  short-lived checklist detail rather than something needing its own note

## 0.8.0

- Added a **graph view** (ribbon button under the machine log, or "Open
  graph view" in the command palette) — an interactive connection map of
  the vault like Obsidian's: every note is a dot, every `[[wiki-link]]` a
  line. Zoom with the scroll wheel, pan and rearrange by dragging, hover
  to spotlight a note's connections, click a note to open it. Unresolved
  links and orphan notes can be toggled on/off, and a filter box
  spotlights notes by name

## 0.7.0

- Pressing **Enter** on a fresh task now seeds its attached note with a
  small template — a `Date Entered` line stamped with today's date and an
  empty `Notes:` line, caret ready to type — instead of a single blank
  indented line
- Weekly note templates support a new `{{weekdays}}` placeholder that
  expands to the seven days of the current week as headings, so a weekly
  note comes prefilled with a dated spot for each day; the starter template
  now uses it
- Added a bundled **GitHub Copilot instructions** doc (**Settings → General**)
  that teaches Copilot KNote's note format — copy it into a vault's
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to get correctly-formatted tasks, due
  dates, and wiki-links out of Copilot

## 0.6.0

- Fixed a Kanban board bug where clicking a task's note the first time
  jumped to the top of the note instead of the task's line (a second click
  landed correctly) — the editor was scrolling before it had measured its
  layout on a fresh open
- Fixed selecting/highlighting text so it's actually visible — it was
  hidden behind opaque backgrounds on task lines and code blocks in the
  editor, and could blend into the background in the Kanban board's task
  editor
- Tag and `[[link` suggestions (in the editor and the tag picker popover)
  can now be cycled with `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` and chosen with `Enter`, instead
  of requiring a mouse click
- Priority markers (`!`, `!!`, `!!!`) now render as a colored pill badge in
  the live-preview editor, matching the look of `#tags`, instead of plain
  exclamation marks

## 0.5.0

- A task's attached note (the indented lines under a `- [ ]` checkbox) now
  renders as a bordered, collapsible box in the live-preview editor — click
  the arrow on the task line to fold the note away and back. Every task gets
  the same box outline for a consistent look, even ones with no note to fold

## 0.4.0

- **Outline panel**: the right sidebar now shows a collapsible outline of
  the open note's headings — click one to jump to it
- **Archive all**: the Kanban board's Done column has an "Archive all"
  button to clear out finished cards in one click, instead of archiving
  each one individually
- Wrapped lines in a task's attached note now stay visually indented under
  the note text instead of falling back flush-left
- Every new note is automatically stamped with a `created` date in its
  frontmatter, so notes carry a reliable timestamp even if a sync tool
  later resets the file's modified time
- **Quick capture** (`Ctrl+J`): jot a thought from anywhere, even with no
  note open — it appends a timestamped line to this week's note (creating
  it from your weekly template if needed) and leaves you right where you
  were
- The **Tags** panel has a new **(no tags)** row listing notes you haven't
  tagged yet, for periodically reviewing and processing fleeting captures

## 0.3.0

- Added a project README describing the app and its features on GitHub

## 0.2.0

- Automated build: merging to `main` now runs typecheck/tests and publishes a
  built Windows installer as a GitHub Release

## 0.1.0

Initial feature set:

- Markdown editor with live preview, source, and reading modes
- Kanban board driven by checkbox tasks in notes (tags, due dates, priority,
  archiving), with a dedicated Settings section for columns

- Weekly notes and note templates with placeholder support
- Full-vault search, quick switcher, tag browser, backlinks/properties panel
